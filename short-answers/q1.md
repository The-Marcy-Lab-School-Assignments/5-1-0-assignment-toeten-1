What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance methods/properties are created within the constructor using this and are specific to each instance, while class methods/properties are created using the static keyword and belong to the class itself. Instance methods are called on an instance of the class, whereas class methods are called on the class itself.
